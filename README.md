        npm install --dev

## How to Run Cypress Frontend Testing 

**1. Open Cypress Application:**
- Run Command to open the application

        npx cypress open
  

**2. Select E2E Testing**
- A window will open with two options to select from. Choose the E2E testing.

**2. Select Current Browser**
- A window will open with multiple browser options, select your preferred browser and click on the start E2E testing on "selected" browser button.

## How to setup Jest Backend Testing:

**1. Access Terminal or PowerShell:**
- Open your terminal and navigate to the cloned folder.

**2. Change Directory to Testing Folder:**
- Execute the command in the terminal to navigate to the testing directory.
  
        cd ./testing/
  
**3. Install Jest:**
- Run Command to install necessary dependencies. If cypress testing is done then install command is not neccessary.

        npm install -D 

## How to Run Jest Backend Testing 

**1. Run Test:**
- Run Command to see the test result.

      node ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --runInBand

The handler.t.js file inside \_\_test\_\_ includes the tests that are being run.

## Process Overview:

1. **Wireframe Development:**
    - Initial creation of a basic mockup to outline the user interface's structure and functionalities on Figma.

2. **High-Fidelity Design:**
    - Enhanced and detailed design development based on the Figma wireframe, focusing on user experience and visual aesthetics.

3. **Implementation using React:**
    - Translating the designed interface into a functional web application using React framework.

4. **Integration of Geographic Information:**
    - Utilization of latitude and longitude data obtained from the API to incorporate a geographical map feature.

4. **Integration of Cypress and Jest Testing:**
    - Integrated frontend and backend testing.
