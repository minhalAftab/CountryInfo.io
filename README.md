### This is a Coding Challenge for Bounce Insights Software Engineering Intern position

#### Project description : 
Create a webpage that takes in a country name, and makes an API call to RESTCountries and receives the information. Once that information is received it should be shown on the screen. 

#### My Process: 
1. I created a basic wireframe mockup of the interface
2. Then I created a more Hi-fidelity Design of that mockup.
3. Then I implemented the design on react.
4. I then implemented a map by using the lattitude and langtitude received from API.

#### My Screens Designs: 
1. Very Minimal Landing Page :
   This was kept minimal so the main call to action would be the search feature.

2. Basic infomartion Displayed in a Readable Manner : 
   This Showcases the more relevant and important information more prominently. 

3. Incase of incorrect Country Name Error is shown:
   This showcases error handling.
